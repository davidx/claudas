#  a webhook call from github should trigger a start of cycle
# daemon starts



- **REVIEW**: When a push is made to a pull request branch, it should be evaluated against a default set of rules:
  -  IF PR is reviewed by at least 2 people that aren't the author, continue.
 - **MERGE**: An integration branch is created and a rebase is performed of the pr branch onto the target
  - IF it fails, mark the build as failed, update Github PR comment with status of failure.
 - **BUILD** the branch
  - IF it fails, mark build as failed, update Github PR comment with status of failure.
 - **TEST** the branch with unit tests.
  - IF it fails, mark the build as failed, update Github PR comment with status of failure.
 - **PASS**: Merge, Build and Tests all pass, system merges working integration branch to target branch.
  - System updates Github PR comment with status of success and closes PR

 #### Implementation

 - A running daemon process listens for github webhook calls.
 - When a webhook trigger is received, it conducts a set of steps to evaluate the build.
 - Pulls down PR metadata relating to push
 - Iterates through comments to count nonauthor reviewers
 - creates work area, checks out integration-test branch
 - attempts a rebase of PR branch onto target
 - attempts a build run on the newly merged branch work dir.
 - attempts a test run on the newly built branch work dir.
 - pushes successfully built integration-test branch to target branch
 - updates PR comment with success status
